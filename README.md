## Setup
The development environment is shaped by: 
- Netbeans IDE - version 13
- Java - version 17 LTS (Long Term Support)
- MySQL Workbench- version 8.0.26
- Other files .jar are essential to run the app, they are included into the code/directories



## Usage
It's simple is just a desktop app with its functionalities


## Project Status
Project is: In Progress, the app is almost finished but the main functionality of learning programming lenguajes is not completed/working and maybe a profile user should be added in the near future too.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- The code for the blog handlers could be a lot better, it's inefficient due to the few minutes it took to add it, with time it can be a lot better.
- In the login and registration alerts should appear to correctly guide the user.

To do:
- Implement the main functionality of learning programming languages.
- Improve the blog section.
